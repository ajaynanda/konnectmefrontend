            <h3>Social media terms and conditions</h3>
            <span>The terms, conditions and policies that apply to specific social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, also apply to the KonnectMe profiles they host. We recommend that you familiarise yourself with those terms and conditions before participating in the Community and we disclaim any liability associated with your use of those services, or for your failure to view or comply with their terms, conditions and policies. Where there is a conflict between these Rules and the terms and conditions of the relevant social media channels, the social media channelsâ€™ terms and conditions will prevail.</span>

            <h3>Moderation of the community</h3>
            <span>We strive to create dialogue with users of our Community and encourage you to share content via the Community in accordance with these Rules (Contribution). To help us do that, we try to monitor the Community during normal UK business hours (9am-5pm GMT, Monday to Friday, excluding UK public holidays). We will try to check that all submissions to the Community comply with our acceptable use standards described below (Acceptable Use Standards) as soon as reasonably practicable after publication.

                If in our opinion an individual makes use of the Community in breach of these Rules, we reserve the right to remove, or to disable access to, any Contribution, and to terminate, suspend or change the conditions of their access to the Community without prior warning. We also reserve the right to bring legal proceedings against any individual for a breach of the Rules, or take such other action as we reasonably deem appropriate.
                
                We expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of the Community by any person in contravention of these Rules. While we try to moderate the Community, we are not legally responsible for any material posted by third parties and we may stop, or suspend, moderating the Community at any time.</span>

            <span>The Community is intended for use by individuals aged 18 years or more. Minors must get permission from their parent or guardian before using the Community. We recommend that parents who allow their children to use the Community discuss online safety with their children first and that parents endeavour to monitor any use of the Community. Minors should also be given guidance on how to use the Community safely and in a way that complies with these Rules.</span>
